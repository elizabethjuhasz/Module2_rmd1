# This is a Level 1 Header

## R Markdown

### This is a Level 3 Header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This is a link to [Google.](http://google.com)

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package. 

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Here is an example of a non-numbered list

* Breakfast 
    - food 
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon 
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco

Here is an example of a numbered list: 

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco

Here is an example of block quote: 

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines. 
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item. 

Here is an example of nested block quote:

> This is a block quote. This 
> paragraph has two lines. 
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of code within a block quote. 

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
        caption="Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert an Equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$
